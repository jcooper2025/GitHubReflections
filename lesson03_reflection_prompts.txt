Q01:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A01:
If you want to share the work or have it accessible from different locations. Even if I am the only person using 
it this means I would not have to have a usb drive. I can just commit&push my changes when I am done and fetch them at the new location.
